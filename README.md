# Development of an Intelligent Obstacle Avoidance System for Turtlebot3 using ROS, Gazebo and Laser finder
## INTRODUCTION

Obstacle avoidance is essential for autonomous robots that are used in various applications, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation. The project's primary objective is to create a reliable and efficient obstacle avoidance system that allows Turtlebot3 to navigate through complex environments and avoid obstacles without collisions. The system uses multiple sensors, including a laser range finder, to detect obstacles and implement a reactive approach to control the robot's movements. The reactive approach generates a control command that adjusts the Turtlebot3's movement based on the sensor inputs in real-time. The system can navigate through environments with obstacles of various sizes and shapes.

The project uses a Gazebo simulation environment to test the obstacle avoidance system, and a Python code is implemented to control the Turtlebot3's movement. The Gazebo simulation environment provides a realistic simulation of a real-world environment and allows for testing the obstacle avoidance system under different conditions. The Python programming language is a popular and widely used language in robotics and provides a flexible and powerful tool for controlling the Turtlebot3's movement.

# Getting Started

For developing this project [here](https://github.com/farjana-akter-shifa/ObstacleAvoidanceProject/blob/main/Documentation/Group_2_Obstacle_avoidance_Paper.pdf) is the link of documentation

# Results

Our objective was to make the Turtlebot3 navigate in an 
environment with obstacles and avoid them without collision. 
To achieve this, we used Laser Scan data from the robot's 
sensors and developed a custom algorithm in Python.
